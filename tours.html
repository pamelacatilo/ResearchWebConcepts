		  <h2><span> Best Accomodation in Queenstown </span></h2>
		  <p> As you would expect from one of New Zealand’s busiest tourist destinations, Queenstown is not short on accommodation options from backpackers to five star luxury boutique hotels. Whether you want to stay in the heart of the action in downtown Queenstown or you’re looking for something a bit more remote and off the beaten track, this place caters for everyone! All the big name hotels are found in Queenstown so make sure you do some shopping around as there are always deals to be found although accommodation can get expensive in the peak seasons in summer and winter. We’ve pulled together some of the best tips from our travel explorers covering a wide range of accommodation options. Here we go! </p>

          <p><strong> Sofitel Queenstown Hotel and Spa </strong></p>
          <p>Let's start with one of the big boys. The <a href="https://sofitel.accorhotels.com/australia/index.en.shtml" data-wpel-link="external" rel="nofollow">Sofitel in Queenstown</a> is one of the most luxurious hotels in the city so if you have a big budget for your trip and you want to splurge on somewhere special, this is the place! The hotel is situated right in the heart of the city just minutes from the stunning Lake Wakatipu and all the best bars and restaurants. GO Explorers Carol and Steve stayed here on a recent trip and couldn’t believe the experience. The service was ‘out of this world’ and the place just made you feel very special. So there you have it. Luxury accommodation option – tick!</p>

          <p><strong> Villa Del Lago</strong></p>
		  <p>We know a lot of visitors to New Zealand want to keep the cost of their trip down by staying in places where you can cook your own food and relax in a living room – things you don’t get in a typical hotel. The <a href="https://www.villadellago.co.nz/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="nofollow">Villa del Lago</a> apartments are some of the best in Queenstown (although there are heaps to choose from). What sets this place apart are the stunning views – uninterrupted over Lake Wakatipu with the Remarkables mountain range in the backdrop. Imagine waking up and sipping coffee on your balcony with that view every morning. Yes please! The apartments also border the Queenstown Trail making it easy to get around whether you are heading into town or further afield.</p>

          <p><strong> Queenstown Holiday Park and Motel Creeksyde</strong></p>
		  <p>Holiday parks are a big part of New Zealand’s holiday scene. From camping to lodges to motel rooms, the <a href="https://www.camp.co.nz/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="nofollow">Queenstown Holiday Park and Motel Creeksyde</a> caters for a wide range of budgets and is also camper van friendly making this a good option for a wide range of travellers. Creeksyde is an easy 5 minute walk from the city centre making this an ideal spot to base yourself for a few days. The park is set in several acres of beautiful green space and has some great BBQ areas, a laundry as well as great ski and bike storage. If you are looking to save some pennies, this could be a really great option.</p>

		  <p><strong> Ramada Hotel and Suite Queenstown Remarkables Park</strong></p>
		  <p> We haven’t featured too many of the chain hotels in these recommendations although plenty did pop up. Perhaps the most popular tip when it comes to hotels is the Ramada Hotel and Suites at Queenstown Remarkables Park. This place is extremely popular with skiers as it’s located close to some of New Zealand’s best ski fields and is only minutes from the airport. The hotel has everything you would expect from a leading chain – fitness centre, free parking, free WiFi…it does exactly what you expect but what sets it apart is the stunning locations with amazing views over the Remarkables mountain range and a really laid back feel.</p>
		  <h2><span>Best Places to eat out in Queenstown</span></h2>
		  <p> Queenstown is packed full of great places to eat out. Whether it’s cheap street eats or a fancy dinner you’re looking for, this place has got you covered! Again we were overwhelmed with suggestions for places to eat so we’ve tried to narrow things down by the most popular suggestions and also looking at a range of cuisine and budgets – we’d love to hear your suggestions so make sure you let us know if we have missed off any of the amazing places to eat out in Queenstown. </p>
          <div class="clr"></div>
		  <ul class="sb_menu">
            <li><a href="https://fergburger.com/"><strong>Ferburger</strong></a></li> <p> OK. So, even if you have never been to Queenstown before, you may already know about the legend of Fergburger. Celebrities around the world have eaten here including Ed Sheeran so they don’t need to do much marketing to get people through the door. As you head down the main street in Queenstown (Shotover St) you will see the queue. From around 10am to 10pm, people are literally queuing out of the door to sample one of the famous burgers and it would be remiss of you to leave town without sampling one!</p>
            <li><a href="www.caribelatinkitchen.com"><strong>Caribe Latin Kitchen</strong></a></li> <p> Another top tip from Traveler Explorer Carly in her blog above is Caribe Latin Kitchen. This is a super down to earth eatery serving up some pretty amazing Mexican and Latin American eats along with their firey homemade hot sauce. A top tip from Carly is the burritos. Whether you’re a veggie or a meat eater, they’ve got you covered and they are super filling so great for dinner or a hearty lunch! If you want to try something a big different, the arepas are pretty tasty too.</p>
            <li><a href="https://www.madamwoo.co.nz/locations/queenstown-restaurant/"><strong>Madame Woo</strong></a></li> <p> This place in one of the few chain restaurants to make it on to any of our Complete Guides and that’s because each location offers something a bit different. Taking inspiration from traditional Malaysian Hawker food, Madam Woo serves up big, fresh flavours that will leave you wondering why you didn’t visit one of the other locations already! A top tip from our Explorers are the hawker rolls which come in a variety of flavours including pulled pork, periperi chicken and eggplant – they are sensational! </p>
            <li><a href="https://pubonwharf.co.nz/"><strong>Pub on Wharf</strong></a></li> <p> If you are looking for something relatively cheap, a great atmosphere and good beer, then Pub on Wharf is the badger. With no meal over 20 bucks and a great range of Macs beer as well as a great wine list, Pub on Wharf is a great option for a night out. With live music every night of the week from local bands, this place always has a great atmosphere as well as enjoying a stunning waterfront location. The beer also comes in a proper pint glass you if you are missing your traditional English pints, this place has you covered! </p>
            <li><a href="https://www.tacomedic.co.nz/"><strong>Taco Medic</strong></a></li> <p> Queenstown is a great place for cheap eats and Taco Medic is another awesome place to pick up a quick bite at either lunch or dinner. Taco Medic had so many recommendations from our Travel Explorers that it had to make the list. Taco Medic offers up the very best of Mexican cuisine with a Kiwi touch. Grab an authentic Mexican Masa Tortilla filled with the very best New Zealand ingredients and enjoy some of the finest tasting food this side of Mexico City! </p>
            <li><a href="https://www.eriksfishandchips.co.nz/"><strong>Erick's Fish and Chips</strong></a></li> <p> A list of places to eat out in New Zealand would not be complete without a fish and chip shop! Queenstown has plenty to choose from but Erik’s was definitely the most popular. Erik has been cooking delicious fish and chips in Queenstown for 30 years and he loves the place. He sources all his ingredients locally from the Timaru potatoes to the fresh fish from Dunedin. He also uses rice bran oil which is made from sustainably grown rice and is packed with antioxidants and is 100% cholesterol free. They almost sound like healthy fish and chips to us!</p>
			<li><a href="https://amisfield.co.nz/"><strong>Amisfield Winery and Bistro</strong></a></li> <p> A trip out wine tasting to one of the many vineyards of the Central Otago region is a must on a visit to Queenstown and if you are looking to take that experience to the next level, we highly recommend heading out to one of these amazing vineyards for a spot of lunch or dinner. Amisfield is one of the most popular options and their bistro is absolutely stunning. We love this one review from Cuisine Magazine, “Amisfield’s genius is in making you fell that there’s no better place in the world to be at that moment”. We can second that. </p>
			<li><a href="https://lunchtime.co.nz/Arrowtown-Bakery-and-Cafe/Queenstown-Lakes/menu/"><strong>Arrowtown Bakery</strong></a></li> <p> OK. So this one is technically not in Queenstown but it’s so good it’s worth the drive! Arrowtown is a short 20 minute drive from Queenstown and is well worth a trip out anyway. Once you get there and explore the quaint little high street, head to the far end where you will find the Arrowtown Bakery. Once you step inside, prepare yourself for one of life’s biggest decisions – which of the amazing pies should I have! Arrowtown Bakery often has people queuing out of the doors and for good reason. Their gourmet pies are to die for. Our top tip? The venison pie is a winner every single time.</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.joes.co.nz/queenstown"><strong>Joe's Garage</strong></a></li> <p>Queenstown, like most towns and cities in New Zealand has some awesome cafes. The best one we have found (thanks to our Travel Explorers!) is Joe’s Garage. Tucked away down a side street on Searle Lane, Joe’s Garage has a super friendly, laid back atmosphere. They welcome dogs and kids and they always have some great tunes playing. Oh yeah. They also serve up some tasty coffee and some amazing breakfast dishes so they tick all the vital boxes when you need an early morning fix! </p>
          </ul>
