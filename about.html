          <h2><span>About</span> TravelNZ</h2>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>The NZTravel Blog and Community Trust is a group of New Zealanders enjoying exclusive healthcare and holiday accommodation benefits made possible by their generous participation in something quite unique.</p> 
		  <p>The Trust's legacy of care started 75 years ago, focused on providing Manaakitanga in the form of holiday homes for convalescing soldiers and their families after WW2.</p>
          <p>NZTravel cares about the people it serves. </p>
          <p>Plenty of businesses claim to have your best interests at heart but it’s a claim that rarely rings true. </p>
          <p>NZTravel isn’t like other organisations. </p>
          <p>To start with, it’s not a business, it doesn’t have shareholders or a corporate owner, and it’s not even out to make a profit.</p>
          <p>In fact, the only people NZTravel really reports to are the people in the NZTravel community – employees of the affiliated organisations and their families. </p>
          <p>NZTravel was founded on the principles of Manaakitanga - caring for others and giving a helping hand when it’s needed.</p>
          <p>The only nod to the business world is to maintain financial stability and stay relevant  for the Kaitiakitanga or generations to come.</p>

          <h2><span> Governance </span></h2>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>The NZTravel Blog and Community Trust is a not-for-profit organisation governed by a Trust Deed and Board of Trustees. It’s a registered charitable trust in terms of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, but isn’t a registered charity in terms of the Charities Act 2005, so it doesn’t qualify for tax exemption.</p>
          <br />
		  <h2><span> Funding </span></h2>
		  <p>The initial funding to establish the holiday homes network came from war bond fees. When this option was depleted, funding came from regular contributions by Post Office employees.</p>
		  <p>Today, NZTravel is funded by the holiday home rentals, contributions and income from investments.</p>
          <p>The funding provides money to reimburse healthcare expenses, heavily subsidise the rental cost of the holiday homes and maintain the homes. Any excess is retained in the Trust.</p>
